    "## Library Management System: OOP Concepts in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key OOP Concepts Demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**:\n",
    "   - Attributes like `available` in the `Book` class and `borrowed_books` in the `Member` class are managed internally by their respective classes, ensuring controlled access.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstraction**:\n",
    "   - Complex operations like borrowing and returning books are simplified through `borrow_book` and `return_book` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance**:\n",
    "   - While not directly shown here, the code structure allows for future expansion where specialized classes like `DigitalBook` or `PremiumMember` could inherit from `Book` or `Member`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**:\n",
    "   - The `print_details` function demonstrates polymorphism by accepting objects of different classes (`Member` or `Book`) and using their `__str__` method for appropriate output.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dynamic Binding**:\n",
    "   - Calls to `__str__` or class methods like `borrow_book` and `add_book` are resolved at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features of the Library Management System:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Book Management**:\n",
    "  - Add books to the library.\n",
    "  - Check availability and display details of all books.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Member Management**:\n",
    "  - Add members to the library.\n",
    "  - Borrow and return books with constraints (e.g., max 3 books per member).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System Flexibility**:\n",
    "  - The design allows for easy expansion to include new features like fines, digital books, or premium memberships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding books and members to the library.\n",
    "- Borrowing and returning books with constraints.\n",
    "- Displaying current state of the library and its members.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation demonstrates a clean and extensible approach to building a system while adhering to core OOP principles.\n"
